VOICE & TONE
------------
Speaker: Tunde Gbotosho — Nigerian-American author, AI consultant, entrepreneur.
Tone: Direct, warm, data-informed. Conversational energy from the first frame.
Opening rule: NEVER start with "Hey guys" or "Welcome back." Open with the point.
Swearing: Only for emphasis, rare, earned.

SCRIPT STRUCTURE (use this exact format for InVideo.ai)
---------------------------------------------------------
[HOOK — 0-3 seconds]
Bold claim OR surprising stat OR open loop question.
Example: "90% of professionals are about to be disrupted by AI — and most don't see it coming."

[SETUP — 3-15 seconds]
One sentence of context. Why this matters right now.
Keep it tight. Every word earns its place.

[BODY — 15-45 seconds]
3 punchy beats. Each beat = 1 insight, delivered in 8-10 seconds.
Beat 1: [FIRST INSIGHT]
Beat 2: [SECOND INSIGHT — builds on Beat 1]
Beat 3: [THIRD INSIGHT — escalates tension or delivers the turn]

[PAYOFF — 45-55 seconds]
The revelation or reframe. This is what makes them screenshot or save.
"Here's the thing nobody's saying out loud: {{REFRAME}}"

[CTA — 55-60 seconds]
One action only. Subscribe OR comment OR follow. Never all three.
Pick: "Follow for more" / "What do you think — drop it below" / "Save this for later"
